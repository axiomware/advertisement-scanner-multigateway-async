# advertisement-scanner-multigateway-async
Capture advertisements packets and store to file, Multi-gateway support

Nodejs example of using [Axiomware's](http://www.axiomware.com) [netrunr-gapi-async](http://www.axiomware.com/apidocs/index.html) Javascript SDK to use multiple gateways to scan for advertisements and save to CSV file

Program to illustrate the use of Netrunr API functions. The program will perform the following functions: 1) connect to your account, 2) list all gateways associated with this account, 3) connect to one or more selected gateways from the list, 4) initiate advertisement scan and print(to screen and file) key information from the advertisement packets, 5) Step 4 is repeated until user ends the program by using CTRL-C.


**This example uses promises and async/await functionality present in Nodejs version 8.+**.

## Requirements

- One or more [Netrunr B24C](http://www.axiomware.com/netrunr-b24c-product.html) gateway
- Axiomware cloud account. See the Netrunr [quick start guide](http://www.axiomware.com/page-netrunr-b24c-qs-guide.html) on creating an account.
- Nodejs (see [https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/) for download and installation instructions)
  - Nodejs version 8.x.x is required due to the use of promises/async/await
- NPM (Node package manager - part of Nodejs)   
- Windows, MacOS or Linux computer with access to internet
- One or more Bluetooth LE devices that are advertising.

## Installation

Clone the repo

`git clone https://github.com/axiomware/advertisement-scanner-multigateway-async.git`

or download as zip file to a local directory and unzip.

Install all module dependencies by running the following command inside the directory

  `npm install`

## Optional customization before running the program
- If you are not able to locate your device, you can try to scan using the active mode. The Bluetooth®️LE name of some devices is located in advertisement_scan_response. An advertisement_scan_response is obtained only during an active scan.
- Change the content of information printed on the screen by modifying `axAdvExtractData()` function.
```javascript
function axAdvExtractData(advItem) {
    advObj = {
        ts: dateTime(advItem.tss + 1e-6 * advItem.tsus),    //Time stamp
        did: addrDisplaySwapEndianness(advItem.did),        //BLE address
        dt: advItem.dtype,                                  // Adress type
        ev: advItem.ev,                                     //adv packet type
        rssi: advItem.rssi,                                 //adv packet RSSI in dBm
        name: axParseAdvGetName(advItem.adv, advItem.rsp),  //BLE device name
        //adv1: advItem.adv,       //payload of adv packet - uncomment to print on screen
        //rsp1: advItem.rsp,       //payload of rsp packet - uncomment to print on screen
    };
    return advObj;
}
```

## Usage

Run the nodejs application:

    node appAdvMultiGW.js

To exit the program, use:

    CTRL-C  

## Error conditions

- If the program is not able to login, check your credentials.
- If the gateway is not listed in your account, it may not have been successfully provisioned. See the Netrunr [quick start guide](http://www.axiomware.com/page-netrunr-b24c-qs-guide.html) for provisioning the gateway.
- Not able to get version information of the gateway. Check if gateway is powered ON and has access to internet. Also, check if firewall is blocking internet access.
